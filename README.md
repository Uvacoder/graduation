## Project Description

I created this website for fun and for learning purposes. My nephew graduated from high school this year, 2020. Like most 2020 graduates, he did not get the traditional graduation ceremony due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since I was unable to see him 'walk', I created this website, as my way to congratulate and honor him.

It was a learning experience for me in quite a few ways. It was my first time creating an image upload project. It was also my first time using Cloudinary -> it's awesome! They have heaps of features I didn't have time to explore. It was also my first time using React hooks. Not sure I have used them well, best practices, etc. But I continue to try, fail, learn, build, repeat. This project was kind of a last minute thought, so it's not as fleshed out as it could have been. But it worked well as a first project dealing with user image uploads, and it gave me ideas for similar but more advanced projects down the road.

I am using Gatsby as the static site generator, Cloudinary for cloud-based image storage, and Netlify for deployment. You can see the live site [here](https://matthew2020.netlify.app).
